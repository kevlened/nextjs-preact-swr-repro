To repro using Preact:

```
git clone git@github.com:kevlened/nextjs-preact-swr-repro.git
cd nextjs-preact-swr-repro
yarn
yarn dev
```

To see the expected behavior when using normal React:

```
git clone git@github.com:kevlened/nextjs-preact-swr-repro.git
cd nextjs-preact-swr-repro
git checkout react
yarn
yarn dev
```
